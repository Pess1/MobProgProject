# Lift Analyzer

Lift Analyzer is a simple Mobile Application that helps you to track your gym lifts.
It allows you to draw on top of your lifting videos which can be for example used to track
bar path, back angle or how your position stays during bench press. App has also a slow motion 
functionality that sets the video speed to 0.5x normal speed and a simple in app camera to 
take videos but you can use the phone's own app as well since the videos are selected from 
photo library. To get the best experience, I recomend that you take videos in portrait mode.

## Instructions

- Select a video by pressing the button in the middle of top row
- Top row left button plays and pauses the video
- Button next to play is the slow motion button (Changes color to cyan when enabled)
- Video camera icon takes you to the camera page
- Arrow backwards is the undo button for sketches you have made
- Three buttons with paint brushes change the color of your sketch
- The drawing area is everything above the buttons

## Future plans for the app

- Ability to draw straight lines between two points
- Improve camera app
- Background image/video with logo instead of black screen
